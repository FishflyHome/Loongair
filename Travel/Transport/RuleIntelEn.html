                                    <p>3.6.1 Ticket purchased by passenger is only applicable for the
                                    transportation from the origin to destination via any
                                    agreed transition point as listed on the ticket. The fare
                                    paid by passenger is based on CDC’s tariff rules and the
                                    transportation listed on the ticket. Fare is the basic
                                    content of the transportation contract between CDC and
                                    passenger.

                                    the ticket. Coupons that have been used not in sequence

                                    transportation, he must contact CDC in advance. The fare
                                    for passenger’s new transportation will be re-calculated
                                    and passenger will be given the option of accepting the
                                    new price or maintaining his original transportation as
                                    ticketed. If passenger is required to change any aspect of
                                    transportation due to Force Majeure, passenger must
                                    contact CDC as soon as practicable and CDC will use
                                    reasonable efforts to transport passenger to the next

                                    fare.
                                    <p>3.6.4 If passenger changes his transportation without CDC’s
                                    agreement, CDC will assess the correct price for
                                    passenger’s actual travel. Passenger will have to pay any
                                    difference between the price paid and the total price
                                    applicable for the revised transportation.

                                    of travel, can result in an increase of price. Many fares
                                    are valid only on the dates and for the flights shown on
                                    the ticket and may not be changed at all, or only upon
                                    payment of an additional fee.
                                    <p>3.6.6 Each flight coupon contained in a ticket will be accepted
                                    for transportation in the class of service on the date and
                                    flight for which space has been reserved, as shown in the
                                    flight coupon. When a ticket is originally issued without
                                    a reservation being specified, space may be later reserved
                                    subject to CDC’s tariff and the availability of space on the
                                    flight requested.

                                    If passenger does not show up for any flight, for which he
                                    is holding a reservation, without advising CDC in
                                    advance, CDC may cancel passenger’s return or onward
                                    reservations as shown in the ticket.
                                    <p>3.7 On a ticket, CDC’s name is abbreviated as GJ, the airline
                                    designator code of Zhejiang Loong Airlines.

                                    on some flights. Under particular circumstances, it may
                                    result in some passengers’ failure to travel on flights as
                                    arranged. When there is not enough space, CDC will seek
                                    for passengers voluntary to disembark and will help them
                                    check in on priority. For passengers who cannot travel
                                    due to over-booking, CDC will do its best to arrange them
                                    on the soonest available flight, and will give a certain
                                    amount of compensation.

                                    <p>9.1        	Schedules
                                    <p>9.1.1       CDC undertakes to use its best efforts to carry the
                                    passenger and his baggage with reasonable dispatch
                                    and to adhere to published schedules in effect on the date
                                    of travel
                                    <p>9.1.2      	Except in the case of its acts or omissions done recklessly
                                    with intent to cause damage and with knowledge that
                                    damage would probably result, CDC shall not be liable for
                                    errors or omissions in timetables or other published
                                    schedules. Additionally CDC shall not be liable for
                                    representations made by employees, agents or
                                    representatives of CDC as to the dates or times of
                                    departure or arrival or as to the operation of any flight.
                                    <p>9.1.3      	The flight times and aircraft types shown in timetables
                                    may change between the date of publication and the date
                                    passenger actually travel. CDC does not guarantee them to
                                    passenger and they do not form part of contract with CDC.
                                    <p>9.1.4      	Before CDC accepts passenger’s reservation for a flight,
                                    CDC will notify the passenger of the scheduled flight time
                                    in effect as of that time, and it will be shown on Ticket. It
                                    is possible that CDC may need to change the scheduled flight
                                    time subsequent to the issuance of the Ticket.
                                    If passenger provides CDC with effective contact information, CDC
                                    will endeavor to notify the passenger of any such changes.
                                    If, after ticket purchase CDC makes a significant change to
                                    the schedule flight time, which is not acceptable to the
                                    passenger, and CDC is unable to book the passenger on an
                                    alternate flight which is acceptable to passenger, passenger
                                    will be entitled to a refund in accordance with
                                    the regulation of involuntary refund.
                                    <p>9.2        	Cancellation, Changes of Flights
                                    For the following reasons, schedules are subject to cancel, terminate, change, or delay without notice:
                                    <p>9.2.1      	Any government legal provision, regulation, order,
                                    demand or requirement; or
                                    <p>9.2.2       For security of flight; or
                                    <p>9.2.3      	Due to circumstances beyond its control or unable
                                    foreseen.
                                    <p>9.3        	CDC cancels or delays flights due to any of the reasons
                                    provided in Provision 9.2, and therefore fails to provide
                                    reserved seat (including the reserved class), or fails to stop
                                    at passenger’s stopover or destination, or causes a
                                    mis-connection with the reserved consecutive flight, CDC
                                    should appropriately consider passengers’ reasonable
                                    needs and take one or more of the following measures:
                                    <p>9.3.1      	Arrange available seat on subsequent CDC flights for
                                    passenger;
                                    <p>9.3.2      	Make endorsement after getting consent from passenger
                                    and carrier concerned;
                                    <p>9.3.3      	Refund according to rules of involuntary refund.
                                    <p>9.4         Remedies provided in Provision 9.3 are all the options for
                                    passengers. Unless otherwise provided in the Convention,
                                    CDC will have no other liability.
                                    <p>9.5         CDC will take all measures that could reasonably be
                                    required to avoid delay in carrying passenger and his
                                    baggage. CDC shall not be liable if it proves that CDC has
                                    taken all measures that could reasonably be required to
                                    avoid the damage or that it was impossible for CDC to take
                                    such measures.
